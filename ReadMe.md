<p>Simple Tetris style game with a slight modification. The game is faster and more challenging than normal Tetris style games. Manipulate the falling blocks to form lines. The farther you go in the game the faster it gets. If the player can remove 4 lines of blocks at a time the game will reward them by slowing down the speed of the game</p>
